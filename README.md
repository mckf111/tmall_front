# TMALL Front End Practice

This is a front end simulation of the [tmall - the biggest b2c shopping website in China](https://www.tmall.com). The original idea comes from a project practice in a JAVA learning website: [how2j](http://how2j.cn/).

**It is only a training project for my own front end skills, I declare there is no intended violation of the tmall or how2j copyright. Anyone who would like to reuse or redistribute the codes should contact me in the first place, the offender must be investigated!**
