# TMALL Front End Practice

This is a front end simulation of the [tmall - the biggest b2c shopping website in China](https://www.tmall.com). The original idea comes from a project practice in a JAVA learning website: [how2j](http://how2j.cn/).

Most of the project are composed of **HTML, CSS and JQuery**, combined with a minor flavor of **bootstrap** (eg. carousel). The major pages are as below:

1. Home page
